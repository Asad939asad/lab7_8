Spam Detection Model Accuracy Improvement
Initial Accuracy: 95%
Our initial spam detection model was performing with an accuracy of 95%. While this is a relatively high accuracy rate, there is always room for improvement, especially in critical applications like spam detection where false positives or false negatives can have significant consequences.

Approach to Improvement:
To enhance the model's performance, we made adjustments by reducing the test size during model evaluation. This change allowed the model to see more data during training, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Resulting Accuracy: 99%
After implementing this modification, the accuracy of our spam detection model increased to an impressive 99%. This improvement suggests that the model's performance benefited significantly from the additional training data.

Conclusion:
The enhancement in accuracy from 95% to 99% demonstrates the importance of fine-tuning and optimizing machine learning models. By carefully adjusting parameters and considering the dataset's characteristics, we can achieve notable improvements in performance, ensuring more reliable and effective spam detection capabilities.
